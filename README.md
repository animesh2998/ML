Goals - 
 - Re-code all algos taught in Andrew NG basic course and the udemy course.
 - Supervised learning major algos implement - normally
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - ANN
    - SVM
    - Decision Trees, Random Forest, GBM
    - XGBoost
 - Unsupervised learning
    - KNN
    - K-means clustering
    - recommender systems
    - RL
 - Deep Learning
    - code ANNs to fit complex data
    - Vision
        - RNNs
        - Diffusion
        - GANs
